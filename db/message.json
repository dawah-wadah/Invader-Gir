Was not expecting that.\nTo answer the many comments, I did not mean to brag about how awesome I am that I let bikers pass and trucks merge. I've been feeling pretty down lately and this was just one example that I realized the other day of how my life feels now. I was hoping to get a little pick-me-up and you guys sure did deliver.
