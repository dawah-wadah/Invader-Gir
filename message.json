To help with this decision, I've been signing up for ride alongs with my local PD to get an idea of what to expect. Go for a few, not much happens, everything's pretty low-key.\n\nThat is, until Friday night. \n\nMeet an officer at the station. He's a nice, young guy, only been on the force for a few months. The night is pretty uneventful, and we start to get towards the end of the shift when dispatch alerts us of a robbery-in-progress at a housing development near our location. As we pull up on the scene, he and I notice two different things at the same time. First, there are four individuals standing at the door of the house smoking and acting casual. Second, there's no backup. \n\nAs we further approach the location, the individuals outside the house move away towards the sidewalk. My officer exits the vehicle and approaches the men, asking what they're doing, and then moves towards the house. The four men close in behind him.\n\nHe doesn't notice.\n\nSensing a threat, I start to move my hand to the radio when one of the individuals looks back towards the car, and we lock eyes. \n\nEyes wide, he smacks his now tense companions to get their attention, and points back towards the car at me. Realizing my presence, they move away down the street. I lose visual.\n\nOfficer gets to the door, knocks, and when no one answers, he moves to the side of the house, but can't see anybody. He continues to stand by the front door for a few minutes. Backup still hasn't come. \n\nWe then get another call from dispatch, stating that the person who called from that location is now reporting that there are men fighting outside his residence. My officer double checks his location, and we're at the right place. There's no one there, and there's definitely no fight going on.\n\nMy officer then asks dispatch to call the caller back and request that he meets him at the front door. \"Sure thing,\" dispatch replies. There's then about a minute of silent tension, broken by the crackle of dispatch on the radio.\n\n\"The number has just been disconnected.\"\n\nThe hair on the back of my neck rises, and my officer rushes back to the vehicle. He gets on the phone with his supervisor, who instructs him to vacate the scene immediately. As we begin to pull out, the front door opens, and a man holding a knife watches us leave. We then see him greet the four men from before in a friendly manner from the rearview mirror as we drive away.\n\nThis was my first tense encounter on a ride along, and since I'm signed up for three more in the next two weeks, I'm sure it won't be my last. This ended up being a good scenario, as my officer ended his shift safe, albeit shaken. Had the four men not seen me, or decided to disregard my presence, it could have ended up much worse for him and myself. \n\nWithout a doubt, there are bad cops out there. I've met a few in my time looking into the career path. But I wanted to share this experience with you all to give you an idea of what an officer may face while on the job. These guys are just trying to do their job and better their communities, and get home safe to their families at the end of watch. With all the stress that comes with the job, let's give them our support.\n\nGod bless, all. OP out.\n\n#meme #police #scary #truestory #blueline","images":["https://i.imgur.com/CrYvSC5.png"],"comments":[{"comment":"So WTF were they trying to do?
