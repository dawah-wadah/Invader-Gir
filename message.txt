I think they get overlooked too often.","children":[{"comment":"Well said. Reeves may have have delivered it well, but he didn't write the script,  did he?","children":[{"comment":"Or did he?","children":[{"comment":"https://i.imgur.com/7j15tXU.jpg","children":[{"comment":"http://i.imgur.com/49z4BQC.gif"}]},{"comment":"Well he's like 1000 years old, for all we know he's written every script there is.","children":[{"comment":"for all we know he could be stealing 1000 year old scripts","children":[{"comment":"https://i.imgur.com/fcPSfwK.gif - Do you want THEM to hear you?"}]}]},{"comment":"Dun dun duuuuuuuun"},{"comment":"Or did he?"},{"comment":"he didnt (for clarification)","children":[{"comment":"Or... Did he?"}]}]},{"comment":"Probably not, but hard to say. Actors can sometimes have substantial creative input. E.g. \"I think the character would say this instead\"","children":[{"comment":"Not usually with text as substantial as this though.","children":[{"comment":"I think it depends from actor to actor and director to director. Robin Williams had a lot of creative freedom IIRC, usually","children":[{"comment":"whereas someone like, say, emma watson doesn't, if beauty and the beast and the circle are any indication. matter of personality/respect"}]}]},{"comment":"\"I love you, I love you, l love you, I love you, I love you...\"  http://i.imgur.com/wGEOKS1.gif","children":[{"comment":"I know."},{"comment":"Context: https://youtu.be/YMzV96LV6Cc"},{"comment":"https://i.imgur.com/erPuvG1.gif"}]},{"comment":"In some cases actors say fuck the script and its so good the director says \"use that instead\" don't know if that happened here but still."},{"comment":"This, altho it's more usual in movies. James Dean is example about this, he ruined many shots with improvising, but when he did it right/1","children":[{"comment":"he fuckin' nailed it. It was method acting. Nowadays you can't do it, because every shot costs way too much. 2/2"}]}]},{"comment":"There has to be a combination of good writing and someone who can deliver it effectively. You can't give more credit to one over the other.","children":[{"comment":"This. It doesn't matter how well written it is unless it's delivered well. And it doesn't matter how well delivered unless it's well written","children":[{"comment":"What if Anakin Skywalker was played by Morgan Freeman... \"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere...\"","children":[{"comment":"If we have to play devil's advocate, George Lucas told Hayde Christensen to imitate Vader's cadence and that messed it up,or so they told me"}]},{"comment":"I'm not saying you're wrong, but... I would argue that a shit actor can't be saved by fantastic lines, but shit lines can be ignored by a >","children":[{"comment":"> phenomenal actor and reinterpreted into something good. The best actors rarely deliver all of their lines directly as written.","children":[{"comment":"Nah fam. I'm just saying you need both in order for it to have the right effect."}]}]}]},{"comment":"I dunno, I wouldn't say it's 50/50. The writers make the main contribution. Even if we only read this it would be good.","children":[{"comment":"But for every way an actor could improve a line they could also make it worse, so if nothing else he did the writing justice."}]}]},{"comment":"He invented it on the spot. He literally thought he was a doctor. He's on drugs.","children":[{"comment":"Yes, but he was also a doctor from 1840 to 1873.  He remembers a conversation with Prudence Goodwyfe very similar to this one.  Acting!"}]},{"comment":"He did choose to be in the movie though, compared to say our boy Nick Cage who chooses to be in stupid shit all the time","children":[{"comment":"\"nicholas cage is a good acctor in good movies and an indispencible acctor on bad movies\""}]},{"comment":"most actors change on the fly to fit the person they are playing... its not word for word.  I think its a mix of both","children":[{"comment":"You'd be surprised how close to the script most directors stay. Especially with serious drama."}]},{"comment":"Good dialogue like this is 50% writing 50% acting. A good performance is more than just the words."},{"comment":"Ben Affleck has had some amazing work he's given himself. And he's made amazing work of other people writing for him. Keanu is good."},{"comment":"Marti Noxon, writer/director","children":[{"comment":"Buffy writer too."}]},{"comment":"you're right, fuck him","children":[{"comment":"Not quite what I meant.","children":[{"comment":"lol  i know, just a joke","children":[{"comment":"http://i.imgur.com/FdZcAGJ.gif"}]}]}]}]},{"comment":"http://i.imgur.com/0Iw1kfi.gif","children":[{"comment":"https://i.imgur.com/7wzxeLA.gif"},{"comment":"http://i.imgur.com/0Iw1kfi.gif","children":[{"comment":"http://i.imgur.com/0Iw1kfi.gif"}]},{"comment":"http://i.imgur.com/fEJBHhO.jpg"}]},{"comment":"yeah its crazy, also tv show wise it seems some actors even get the blame for badly written characters","children":[{"comment":"Yes like the kid who played Anakin in Star Wars Episode I. Grown up people bullied and threatened this kid and fucked up his life.","children":[{"comment":"What"},{"comment":"Fucking right... Lucas made even Portman and McGregor seem terrible in those movies.","children":[{"comment":"Idk, I think McGregor still did really well, despite the poor writing"}]},{"comment":"https://i.imgur.com/AYCJUaoh.jpg","children":[{"comment":"Now that’s podracing"},{"comment":"25 meters... such a long chase."}]}]},{"comment":"Just like retail workers get yelled at for products their company is selling. Happens everywhere in life I guess haha..ppl are idiots"},{"comment":"Like Hayden Christensen. That poor sap, he tried his best but those lines were god awful","children":[{"comment":"Some of his shit is The Room levels of memeworthy though, so we got something good out of the deal at least."},{"comment":"Eh, it's not like his other performances are miles better anyways."}]}]},{"comment":"I'm a big fan of Imgur and I think a lot of credit should go to to good comments like this. Thank you for helping me to keep this in mind."},{"comment":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5541240/  Writer & Director: Marti Noxon","children":[{"comment":"Nice thanks for the info"},{"comment":"Wasn't it based on her own life?"},{"comment":"Friends creator?"}]},{"comment":"That’s fair, but if nick cage (praise be unto him) we’re delivering these lines, I doubt they’d be as powerful...","children":[{"comment":"Exactly. Can you imagine, say, Seinfeld delivering this well? Delivery is a huge part of entertainment quality.","children":[{"comment":"What’s the DEAL with reassurance? Some people want it, some people don’t. (Pause for laughter). Why can’t we just face hard facts?","children":[{"comment":"... I now want Seinfeld Psychiatry to be a thing."}]},{"comment":"[deleted]","children":[{"comment":"I mean, it's all talk, and we're supposed to feel better? C'mon."}]}]}]},{"comment":"Amen. Writers do an amazing job too!!","children":[{"comment":"Except the writers of game of thrones."}]},{"comment":"Shhh don't let anyone know that there are hundreds of talented people behind these movies and that actors are just one part of that"},{"comment":"Marti Noxon. Also directed by."},{"comment":"I think Keanu has impeccable taste in picking his scripts. After a bad run early he knows what he can do now and which roles to take.","children":[{"comment":"Or, whenever one goes awry he just gets in the phone booth and fixes it!  Can't do it every time though, people would get suspicious.","children":[{"comment":"????"}]}]},{"comment":"It goes the other way around too, I've seen people bash certain actors in movies where the problem was clearly the dialogue and script."},{"comment":"Lies. Actors improvise all speeches, designs all the sets and do their make up. That's why they make the big $$$"},{"comment":"JOEY DOESN'T SHARE CREDIT!"},{"comment":"Was gonna say the same"},{"comment":"But he wrote this. I have no proof of that though"},{"comment":"And I’m hopeful that Keanu gives fair share of his income to them. Just like he did with the CGI team during Matrix filming.","children":[{"comment":"It’s not his job to provide salaries."},{"comment":"Common myth; apparently he just took less pay so they could devote it to CGI, not give it directly to the techies.","children":[{"comment":"Effectively does the same thing when you have a set budget they could pay more for the same job. Higher quality comes with higher wage","children":[{"comment":"Eh, this is America, they just do more work, longer hours, and a corporation gets the gold."}]}]}]},{"comment":"That post about him recently said multiple times he gave most of his earnings to special effects and makeup teams so he’s aware I think"},{"comment":"That's a bit facile. That writer couldn't act out what he wrote either. You can't have one without the other. Unless that person is a really","children":[{"comment":"...talented one-man show. Movies are a giant cog of talented people working toward a goal. Not everyone is going to be credited every time.","children":[{"comment":"Actors will always grab most of that limelight, good or bad. People will also blame the actor for poorly written dialogue."}]}]},{"comment":"Writing is key. But it’s still just words on a page. The actor is the one who comes up with how to deliver it. It’s all in the delivery."},{"comment":"A good writer does his job without getting noticed. When you think on him, he messed up, he's supposed to leave his own ambitions","children":[{"comment":"Fine utterance choice, kudos. Yes, observant, unquestionably!"}]},{"comment":"k"},{"comment":"On the flip side, it's harder to admire good writing when poorly delivered. Keifer Sutherland's a horrid voice actor in Armitage Polymatrix.","children":[{"comment":"Agreed I've seen some good performances in crappy movies that weren't enough to carry the movie. Brandon Routh in Superman Returns."}]},{"comment":"Do you know he didn't ad lib that?"},{"comment":"obviously written by someone who's never suffered from major depressive/anxiety disorder but it sounds like it should make sense i guess"},{"comment":"Ding ding ding. The best actors are empty shells with limited personal charisma, it turns out."},{"comment":"Stop, you'll give them an ego. Everyone in show business knows that writers need to be kept in line with savage beatings."},{"comment":"I love you for this comment"},{"comment":"Come on. Of course the writers deserve credit but it's a fucking movie. That's why there are credits.... Facebook comment right here","children":[{"comment":"And he read the script and auditioned for the part. You don't think the writers get paid well? Or he should acknowledge them in the dialogue"}]},{"comment":"Always.  Acting is cool, they convey the art, writers are the soul."},{"comment":"Reeves is in the habit of making a shit script work, though. Often it's the writers giving an actor a lot of good stuff to work with, yes."},{"comment":"Sure but the acting is key too. Devil Wears Prada is a great example of a terrible script but great actors making it amazing."},{"comment":"Psh, I never overlook the writing, only reason actors even have a CHANCE at winning an Oscars"},{"comment":"As a scriptwriter - thank you for remembering this"},{"comment":"Totally agree.  Both deserve the credit, but writers definitely get overlooked."},{"comment":"a writer can write lines, but an actor can take those lines and make them magic. See this performance vs the performances in the prequels"},{"comment":"Writers are amazing and should get their due but can you imagine this read by christopher walken?"},{"comment":"I would say its a little column A and a little column B"},{"comment":"Reeves does a VERY good job of what the writers create which is a huge thing for both of them department-wise","children":[{"comment":"And yes writers get overlooked way too often when a movie is good. When a movie is bad they get torn apart"}]},{"comment":"Written by the true heroes."},{"comment":"Yeah. Few, great actors can make bad dialogue sound great (like p stewart, m freeman) bad actors can make great writing sound bad. 1/2","children":[{"comment":"2/2 Everything else is teamwork. Scaling from Great & great, to twilight. (Though all the dad-characters did great in those flicks)"}]},{"comment":"[Citation needed]"},{"comment":"I think credit should go to the writer's therapist."},{"comment":"https://i.imgur.com/beil8pT.gifv"},{"comment":"He could be good at picking good scripts, or maybe theu're open to here his input."},{"comment":"Let's go down this rabbit hole https://entertainment.theonion.com/mandatory-unisex-golden-globes-uniforms-keep-focus-on-s-1819576009/amp?utm"},{"comment":"Writing is 50% and accurate or powerful portrayals make up the other 50%. It's a team effort. Lighting, cameramen, directing. Everyone helps"},{"comment":"I'm pretty certain a doctor somewhere at some time has said something resembling this."},{"comment":"Which is great, because he's one of the few actors that remembers the little guys."},{"comment":"I would not say \"most\" for me it's 50/50."},{"comment":"Yes! Good writers and good producers willing to work together! Boo to the committee hell-bent on box office records."},{"comment":"This film is fantastic. It was labelled as glorifying eating disorders by some and the ending was iffy but it had some great lessons"},{"comment":"Yes, this bothers me so much. Actors may perform it, but the lines came from the writers."},{"comment":"True... but it helps that it seems like something Keanu would say."},{"comment":"Thats like thanking the guys who made the paint and not picasso.","children":[{"comment":"That's not even remotely the same thing. Not even close.","children":[{"comment":"It's similar, just to a different degree. After all without Arnold, \"I'll be back\" sounds kinda dumb."}]},{"comment":"The writer is Picasso. Reeves is the museum displaying the art for the world."}]},{"comment":"He is mostly bad, but sometimes he shines so very bright, like in this movie. Think it's my favourite performance of his."}]},{"comment":"I heard he reassured her with a pencil. A FUCKING PENCIL!!!","children":[{"comment":"Five stars, would laugh again.","children":[{"comment":"How about 5/7","children":[{"comment":"Perfect."}]}]},{"comment":"https://i.imgur.com/5sSHccO.mp4","children":[{"comment":"Well, I’m certainly reassured"}]},{"comment":"this should've been top comment","children":[{"comment":"https://i.imgur.com/mkxY043.mp4"}]},{"comment":"Who the fuck can do that!?"},{"comment":"Babayega"},{"comment":"I don’t get it?"},{"comment":"HAHAHA damn I haven’t laughed that hard from imgur in ages.

Keanu is a man of many talents.","children":[{"comment":"Which movie is this? is it watchable?","children":[{"comment":"The movie is called \"To the Bone\" as in the title.","children":[{"comment":"You can find it in Netflix i believe.","children":[{"comment":"Can confirm that it is on Netflix.","children":[{"comment":"as for watchability, it address eating/mental disorders and it might be hard to watch. I appreciate Reeves' character and his stance","children":[{"comment":"Totally not trying to be mean here, serious question: but why is an eating disorder \"hard to watch?\" Again, serious question, no picking","children":[{"comment":"If you are suffering from an eating disorder, or know someone who passed because of it, it might be hard to watch?","children":[{"comment":"Idk.. I had a hard time watching someone fictional be unable to overcome the struggle and remember that this is a real issue for many","children":[{"comment":"Thank you for the answer, that helps me understand this movie a bit more. I battled anorexia in HS but now I just eat too much. 1/2","children":[{"comment":"2/2 I never realized, while I was struggling, that people had their lives stolen by it, and can be very hard to escape coupled w/ low esteem","children":[{"comment":"Often times, we are overcome by our own pain and struggles that we don't see the bigger picture. How it's affecting our future","children":[{"comment":"or the people around us :( I sincerely hope you love yourself and know that others love you, too","children":[{"comment":"Thank you so much!!

No blockbuster, kinda same cat  horror drama as the human centipe","children":[{"comment":"...what? horror drama? It's a romance.."},{"comment":"I'd only call it underrated because I've never heard anybody irl or online say anything good about it.

That makes him a unique actor."}]},{"comment":"Damn.  he could be anybody's Psychiatrist and he'd pull it off.  He really put that into this role.
